ChipWhisperer basic-passwdcheck application, intended to be run on a
ChipWhisperer FPGA target (synth_cw305 or synth_cw312a35 targets).

This can then be used with NewAE's "Power Analysis for Password Bypass" 
notebook
(https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-jupyter/tree/master/courses/sca101/),
with modifications to the target clock and baud rate:
    scope.clock.adc_mul = 1 # if using CW-Husky
    scope.clock.adc_src = 'clkgen_x1' # if using CW-lite/pro
    scope.clock.clkgen_freq = 100e6
    target.baud = 115200

Note that the password bypass attack will not work well on the CW305 target
since that target lacks a method to reset the Ibex processor from the host PC
(top_cw305.sv could be modified to achieve this). However it will work on the
CW312-A35 target.

Note that this application (and many others!) can also be built in the
ChipWhisperer repository: 
    https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/tree/develop/hardware/victims/firmware/basic-passwdcheck/
using:
    make PLATFORM=CW305_IBEX CRYPTO_TARGET=NONE
