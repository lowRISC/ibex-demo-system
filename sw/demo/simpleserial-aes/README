ChipWhisperer simpleserial-aes application, intended to be run on a
ChipWhisperer FPGA target (synth_cw305 or synth_cw312a35 targets).

This can then be used with any of the NewAE Jupyter-based courses
(https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-jupyter/tree/master/courses)
which use simpleserial-aes, with modifications to the target clock and baud
rate:
    scope.clock.adc_mul = 1 # if using CW-Husky
    scope.clock.adc_src = 'clkgen_x1' # if using CW-lite/pro
    scope.clock.clkgen_freq = 100e6
    target.baud = 115200

Note that this application (and many others!) can also be built in the
ChipWhisperer repository: 
    https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/tree/develop/hardware/victims/firmware/simpleserial-aes
using:
    make PLATFORM=CW305_IBEX CRYPTO_TARGET=TINYAES128C
