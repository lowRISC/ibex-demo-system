Firant and Xyloni boards (efinix trion T8)
==========================================

``.hex`` file is the default format generated by *Efinity IDE*, so nothing special must be done to generates this file.

*openFPGALoader* supports only active mode (SPI) (*JTAG* is WIP).

hex file load
-------------

.. code-block:: bash

    openFPGALoader -b fireant /somewhere/project/outflow/*.hex

or, for xyloni board

.. code-block:: bash

    openFPGALoader -b xyloni_spi /somewhere/project/outflow/*.hex

Since openFPGALoader access the flash directly in SPI mode the ``-b fireant``, ``-b xyloni_spi`` is required (no
autodetection possible).
